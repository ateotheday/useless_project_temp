# idle cycle üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Coder Cookies


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aathira R N - College of Engineering Munnar
- Member 2: Maria Biju - College of Engineering Munnar


### Project Description
Idle cycle is the ultimate fusion of doing nothing productive in the most creative way possible. It is a calender that does not care about your deadlines and games that serves no real purpose except giving you a break from reality.
Feautures include:
-pointless calender
-breaktime game
-zero productivity guarantee
-mood booster

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There is no app that lets you check a calender and immediately distracts yourself with a completely pointeless game in the same place.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
They build an app that combines a useless calender with an equally useless game, so you can waste time efficiently.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Language:python,html,css,JavaScript
libraries/frameworks: Tkinter (for UI)
Media pipe: for hand tracking in the game 
OpenCV-Python (for camera input in the game)
IDE:VsCode
OS Compatibility:Windows

For Hardware:
Processor:Intel core i5
RAM:8gb
webcam: For media pipe game to work
Display: higher solution screen

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
pip install opencv-python
media pipe mp


# Run
python focus_detect.py
